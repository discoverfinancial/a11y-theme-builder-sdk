# Transferred
Please note that this project (and this repo) **has been transferred** under the leadership of [FINOS](https://www.finos.org).  The repo is now located here: https://github.com/finos/a11y-theme-builder-sdk/  We are excited to continue enhancing Theme Builder with the open governance and support that FINOS provides.

## Accessibility Theme Builder SDK

Accessibility compliance is both a difficult and a cost intensive task.  This is true not only when creating an initially compliant application, but also when maintaining that compliance.

The purpose of this SDK is to simplify this task by performing the necessary calculations and generating output (e.g. CSS, JSON tokens, or other) to be imported into your application.  

This SDK is designed to be extensible with regard to each of the following:

* output generators (e.g. CSS, JSON tokens, etc),
* atoms,
* molecules,
* organisms, and
* accessibility layers (e.g. color blindness, motion sensitivity, etc).
